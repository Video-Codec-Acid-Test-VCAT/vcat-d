## About VCAT

VCAT (Video Codec Acid Test) is a video decoder benchmarking tool for Android devices.

It is designed to evaluate real-world decode performance and platform stability through long-running playback workloads with detailed telemetry collection.

## Key Capabilities

- ✅ **Built on the ExoPlayer framework**  
  – stable, modern media pipeline with full Android platform support

- ✅ **Supports all system video decoders**  
  – hardware-accelerated H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1 (where available)

- ✅ **Bundled dav1d software decoder for AV1**  
  – raises a consistent performance baseline across devices

- ✅ **Long-running decode workloads**  
  – e.g., battery drain testing, thermal behavior, performance throttling studies

- ✅ **Detailed telemetry logging**  
  – battery / CPU usage / CPU frequency / memory / frame drops

- ✅ **Open Source — GPL-3.0-or-later**  
  – free to use, modify, and improve

## Vision

VCAT’s mission is to enable users, developers, and OEMs to understand **how well devices handle modern video standards under real conditions**, not just short synthetic tests.

---

## Project Status

VCAT is currently in active development and preparing for its **first public open-source release**.

✅ Source code  
✅ Telemetry pipeline  
✅ dav1d integration  
🚧 Continuous UI improvements  
🚧 Additional test vector libraries

Feedback is welcome — issues and PRs encouraged!
